# HTTP Queries

`*.http` files in this folder are used for easily querying a running backend.

At least one query for each use case is provided together with [http-client.env.json](http-client.env.json) which defines the `baseURL` (currently the default Spring Boot backend)

## Query Files

* [drivers.http](drivers.http)
* [taxis.http](taxis.http)
* [customers.http](customers.http)
* [locations.http](locations.http)
* [trips.http](trips.http)
* [shifts.http](shifts.http)
